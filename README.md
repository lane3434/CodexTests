# ShadowAI

Master your workflow with real-time automation and AI mimicry.

## Features

- **Real-time input tracking**: Observes keyboard and mouse activity to build an accurate map of your actions.
- **AI mimicry and prediction**: Learns how you work and anticipates your next steps with intelligent suggestions.
- **Pattern-based learning**: Analyzes recurring sequences to refine future predictions and streamline repetitive tasks.
- **Autonomous simulation mode**: Executes full workflows on your behalf while you supervise the results.

## Modes

- **MIMIC Mode**: Duplicates your actions immediately as you perform them, providing live assistance.
- **TRAIN Mode**: Records input data and updates the model to improve future mimicry and prediction.
- **I AM YOU Mode**: Runs ShadowAI autonomously, carrying out tasks and decisions based on your established patterns.

## Usage

1. Download the latest release for your platform and run the `shadowai` executable or Python script.
2. ShadowAI starts in MIMIC Mode by default. Switch modes from the command line or system tray menu.
3. Press the configured hotkey to pause tracking or choose "Exit" from the menu to close the assistant.

## Performance & Tech Stack
