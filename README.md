# ShadowAI

ShadowAI streamlines your workflow through real-time automation and intelligent prediction.

## Features

- **Real-time input tracking**: Monitors keyboard and mouse activity to capture a precise representation of your actions.
- **AI mimicry and prediction**: Learns from your actions to provide accurate, context-aware suggestions.
- **Pattern-based learning**: Analyzes recurring sequences to refine predictions and streamline repetitive tasks.
- **Autonomous simulation mode**: Executes complete workflows under your supervision.

## Modes

- **MIMIC Mode**: Mirrors your actions in real time, offering immediate assistance.
- **TRAIN Mode**: Records input data and updates the model to enhance future mimicry and prediction.
- **I AM YOU Mode**: Operates autonomously, executing tasks and decisions derived from your established patterns.

## Usage

1. Download the latest release for your platform and run the `shadowai` executable or Python script.
2. ShadowAI starts in MIMIC Mode by default; switch modes from the command line or system tray menu as needed.
3. Use the configured hotkey to pause tracking or select "Exit" from the menu to close the assistant.

## Performance & Tech Stack

- Built with Python and C++ for cross-platform compatibility and speed.
- Optimized for a control loop under 30Â milliseconds to maintain seamless interaction.
