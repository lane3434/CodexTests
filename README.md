# ShadowAI

Master your workflow with real-time automation and AI mimicry.

## Features

- **Real-time input tracking**: Observes keyboard and mouse activity to build an accurate map of your actions.
- **AI mimicry and prediction**: Learns how you work and anticipates your next steps with intelligent suggestions.
- **Pattern-based learning**: Analyzes recurring sequences to refine future predictions and streamline repetitive tasks.
- **Autonomous simulation mode**: Executes full workflows on your behalf while you supervise the results.

## Modes

- **MIMIC Mode**: Duplicates your actions immediately as you perform them, providing live assistance.
- **TRAIN Mode**: Records input data and updates the model to improve future mimicry and prediction.
- **I AM YOU Mode**: Runs ShadowAI autonomously, carrying out tasks and decisions based on your established patterns.

## Usage

1. From the `shadowai` folder run `npm install` to set up dependencies.
2. Launch the assistant with `npm start`.
3. Use the on-screen buttons to train, mimic, and replay actions.

## Performance & Tech Stack

- Built with Electron for cross-platform compatibility and speed.
- Optimized for a control loop under 30 milliseconds to maintain seamless interaction.
- Trains models locally using available CPU or GPU resources with no external data transfer.
